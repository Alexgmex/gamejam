# TOP GUN: SPACE FORCE
The year is 2075, and the American Federation Space Force has just developed its first FTL (Faster-than-light) hyperdrive.
As an American Federation Top Gun recruit, you have been tasked with testing this hyperdrive by travelling to the newly discovered Z-27 Lithium asteroid. 
Unfortunately, the Reformed Soviet States have no intention of letting you get to the lithium before them and have opened fire with their Communist lasers.
Can you brave the stars, dodge the reds, and survive long enough to finish listening to Danger Zone in this Red vs Blue classic?
